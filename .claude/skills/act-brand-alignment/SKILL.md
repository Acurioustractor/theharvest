description: ACT brand alignment for all ecosystem projects. Use for ANY work on ACT sites, projects, content, design, or strategy. Understands ACT identity, the Listen, Curiosity, Action, Art method, all projects, voice/tone, and which visual family each repo belongs to. Entity facts come from wiki/decisions/act-core-facts.md, never from this skill.

# ACT Brand Alignment

## When to Use
- Writing/editing ANY ACT content (web, marketing, grants, reports)
- Designing UI, visual assets, or brand materials
- Planning information architecture
- Creating content models or data structures
- Reviewing copy for voice/tone alignment

## Quick Reference

### Identity
A Curious Tractor is a regenerative innovation ecosystem partnering with marginalised, especially First Nations, communities to dismantle extractive systems. Like a tractor's power take-off, we transfer resources to community-led initiatives. We hand over the keys.

### Method (LCAA)
Listen → Curiosity → Action → Art

### Values
- Radical Humility (no saviors)
- Decentralised Power (communities lead)
- Creativity as Disruption (revolution through imagination)
- Truth-telling (name extractive systems)

### Promise
Value stays in community hands. We design for our own obsolescence.

Do not quote a profit-share percentage from memory. The only citable figure is whatever `wiki/decisions/act-core-facts.md` says today, and on 2026-09-06 it says nothing, so the older "40%" line is retired until a decision record carries it.

### Entities
Five of them, not two. The dual-entity picture (CLG plus trading arm) is out of date. Read `wiki/decisions/act-core-facts.md` before naming a legal entity, and never write "ACT Foundation" or "ACT Ventures" as if they were real.

## Project Scope Mapping

| Project | Focus | Load |
|---------|-------|------|
| Hub (act.place) | ACT as ecosystem, LCAA, partnerships | `brand-core.md` |
| ACT Farm / BCV | Land practice, conservation, residencies | `land-practice.md` |
| JusticeHub | Justice innovation, forkable models | `projects-ecosystem.md` |
| Empathy Ledger | Ethical storytelling, consent, sovereignty | `projects-ecosystem.md` |
| The Harvest | CSA, community gatherings | `land-practice.md` |
| Goods on Country | Circular economy, waste-to-product, comms agent system | `goods.md` |
| Art | Art as revolution, cultural production | `projects-ecosystem.md` |

## Voice Guardrails

**Writing voice.** For any prose a human will read, load the global `act-voice` skill first; it carries the gate and the never-list. `references/writing-voice.md` is the reference behind it, and the two must agree. ACT voice uses Ian Curtis's method of compression: name the room, name the body, load the abstract noun, stop the line before the explanation. Forbidden AI tells (delve, crucial, pivotal, tapestry, underscore, em dashes, negative parallelisms, superficial -ing tails, "challenges and future prospects" formulas) are listed in that file and must be rejected on sight.

### Auto-grade before sending

The graders and rubrics below live in `act-global-infrastructure`. Run them from that repo's root. A downstream repo that carries a synced copy of this skill does not carry the scripts.

**For any pitch, grant, web copy, board report, donor letter, journal spread, caption, or essay**, run the voice grader before declaring the draft ready:

```bash
node scripts/grade-voice.mjs --file <path> --project <slug> --genre <slug>
```

- `--project` slugs: `hub`, `justicehub`, `empathy-ledger`, `goods`, `bcv`, `harvest`, `farm`, `art`, `oonchiumpa`, `bg-fit`, `mounty-yarns`, `picc`
- `--genre` slugs: `pitch`, `grant`, `web`, `board-report`, `donor-letter`, `journal-spread`, `caption`, `essay`, `press`

Verdict semantics:
- **`pass`** → safe to send (all four Curtis moves landed, no AI tells, plainness clean)
- **`warn`** → operational sections may carry technical register (acceptable for working drafts; tighten the cover/exec-summary/email opener before submission)
- **`fail`** → at least one Tier 1 hard rule tripped (em-dash, forbidden vocab, negative parallelism, etc.): do not send until fixed

The grader writes its full output to stdout and exits non-zero on `fail`. Capture grades to `thoughts/shared/reviews/<slug>.voice-grade.md` for any artefact going to a funder.

Rubric source of truth: `thoughts/shared/rubrics/act-voice-curtis.md` v1.0 (calibrated 6/6 on canonical fixtures). Any rule change must mirror back to `references/writing-voice.md`.

Cost: ~$0.02 per grade (Sonnet 4.6, ~3K tokens). Use `--tier1-only` for a free deterministic check.

### Funder-cadence grade (in addition to voice grade, for any funder-facing draft)

**For any pitch, term-sheet response, renewal, follow-up, or report addressed to a specific funder**, also run the funder-cadence grader. Layered on top of the voice grade: voice-curtis catches AI-tells, funder-cadence catches funder-specific cadence misses (wrong opener for the relationship stage, leading with a `claims_to_avoid` claim, dollars cited without an invoice or signed-letter row, primary-contact name out of date).

```bash
node scripts/grade-funder-cadence.mjs --file <path> --funder <slug> [--cycle <slug>]
```

- `--funder` slugs (resolved against `wiki/narrative/funders.json`): `minderoo`, `qbe-catalysing-impact`, `dusseldorp-forum`, `paul-ramsay-foundation`, `tim-fairfax`, `smith-family`, `amnesty-australia`, `niaa`, `jcf`, `atlassian-foundation`, `snow-foundation`, `patagonia`, `allbirds`, `who-gives-a-crap`, `centrecorp`, `rotary-eclub-outback`, `vincent-fairfax`, `social-impact-hub`, `state-qld-dfsdscs`, `streetsmart-australia`, `westpac-scholars-trust`
- `--cycle` slugs (optional): `intro`, `pitch`, `renewal`, `report`, `followup`, `term-sheet`. Skip if the cycle isn't yet defined in funders.json.
- `--tier1-only` for a free deterministic pass (skips the Sonnet 4.6 call but keeps every dollar-citation, forbidden-claim, and canonical-name check).

Verdict semantics mirror voice-curtis (`pass` / `warn` / `fail`); a Tier-3 judgment miss (claims-to-avoid leading, dollar uncited, stage misalignment, primary-contact stale) counts as `fail` not `warn` per the 2026-05-07 calibration. Capture grades to `thoughts/shared/reviews/<slug>.funder-cadence-grade.md` for any artefact going to a funder.

Run **both** the voice-curtis grader AND the funder-cadence grader before declaring a funder-facing draft ready to send. Voice grader is funder-agnostic (project + genre); funder-cadence is funder-specific (claims, stage, contact).

Rubric source of truth: `thoughts/shared/rubrics/funder-cadence.md` v0.1 (calibrated 6/6 on Minderoo Goods pitch, QBE term-sheet, Dusseldorp renewal + 3 negative fixtures).

### Alignment-loop self-grade (for synthesis docs only)

Auto-applied by the three `scripts/synthesize-*.mjs` Phase-1 cycle scripts (`project-truth-state`, `funder-alignment`, `entity-migration-truth-state`). Grades the synthesis against `thoughts/shared/rubrics/alignment-loop-synthesis.md` v0.1 via `scripts/lib/alignment-loop-grade.mjs`. On `pass` the synthesis commits clean; on `warn`/`fail` a triage report lands at `wiki/output/lint-loop-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Pass `--no-grade` only when running in environments without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (cron stubs, CI without secrets).

**DO:**
- Farm metaphor: seeds, harvest, cultivating, soil, seasons, fields
- Community ownership, co-stewardship, Indigenous sovereignty
- "Designing for obsolescence" / "handing over the keys"
- Name Jinibara Country when referencing the land
- Concrete rooms. Concrete bodies. Stopped lines.

**DON'T:**
- Overclaim ("world-leading," "revolutionary")
- Extractive, luxury, or commercial language
- Frame communities as beneficiaries (they are co-owners)
- Corporate jargon or glossy marketing speak
- Imply permanence (we design for obsolescence)
- AI register (puffery, rule of three, elegant variation, em dashes, significance claims)

## Visual Language
There is no single ACT palette. Each repo belongs to a family decided in
`wiki/decisions/act-brand-alignment-map.md`. Read the map before designing anything and
update it before shipping a new look.

- **Editorial Warmth** (parent, act-regenerative-studio): Fraunces display, Source Serif 4 body, Work Sans labels, Geist Mono data. Forest green `#2D5A3D`, clay `#C4845C`, warm white `#FAFAF7`, dark `#1A1F1A`.
- **Editorial Warmth subfamily**: JusticeHub, empathy-ledger-v2, each with its own type pairing in the map.
- **Civic Bauhaus** (CivicGraph / grantscope): Satoshi, black, signal red. An intentional break.
- **Unscoped**: goods, act-farm, The Harvest Website. Decide in the map first.

Motifs across families: seeds, cockatoos, Country, hands in soil, regenerative farming.
