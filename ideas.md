  **Design Movement**: Modern Agrarian / Hinterland Chic
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Authenticity**: Use textures and tones that reflect the physical environment of Witta (earth, timber, mist).
  2. **Clarity**: Information density should be high but digestible, using structured grids and clear hierarchy.
  3. **Community**: Visuals should emphasize human connection and gathering.
  4. **Growth**: Use organic shapes and upward motion in animations to symbolize potential.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Deep Forest Green (#2F4F4F) - Represents the lush Blackall Ranges and stability.
  - **Secondary**: Warm Terracotta (#E2725B) - Reflects the red soil and warmth of community.
  - **Accent**: Mist Grey (#E0E5E5) - For backgrounds, representing the hinterland atmosphere.
  - **Text**: Charcoal (#333333) - For readability against light backgrounds.
  - **Intent**: To evoke a sense of groundedness and natural beauty while maintaining professional credibility.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Grid**: Move away from standard centered containers. Use a split-screen approach for key sections (text on one side, visual on the other).
  - **Card-Based SWOT**: The SWOT analysis itself will be presented as an interactive 2x2 grid where each quadrant expands on interaction.
  - **Sticky Navigation**: A side navigation rail that tracks progress through the analysis sections.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Topographic Lines**: Subtle background patterns resembling contour maps of the Blackall Ranges.
  - **Hand-Drawn Icons**: Custom icons for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats that look sketched/organic.
  - **Full-Bleed Imagery**: High-quality photos of the market and landscape used as section breaks.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover-to-Reveal**: Details in the SWOT grid reveal themselves on hover to keep the initial view clean.
  - **Smooth Scroll**: Gentle parallax effects on background images to create depth.
  - **Data Visualization**: Animated charts for demographic and economic data.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade-in Up**: Content elements slide up and fade in as the user scrolls.
  - **Staggered Reveal**: List items (like specific strengths) appear one after another.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Playfair Display* (Serif) - Elegant, traditional, reflecting the history of the Old Witta School.
  - **Body**: *Lato* (Sans-Serif) - Clean, modern, highly readable for dense text.
  - **Accents**: *Caveat* (Handwriting) - Used sparingly for "notes" or emphasis to add a human touch.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Eco-Modernist Twist)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid Systems**: Strict adherence to a mathematical grid for organizing complex information.
  2. **Objective Photography**: Using honest, unmanipulated images of the location and people.
  3. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic balance rather than centered symmetry.
  4. **Sans-Serif Typography**: Primary vehicle for communication.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Palette**: High-contrast black and white base with vibrant "Eco-Neon" accents.
  - **Accent 1**: Neon Green (#39FF14) - representing fresh growth and innovation.
  - **Accent 2**: Solar Yellow (#FFD700) - representing energy and optimism.
  - **Intent**: To present the analysis as a forward-thinking, data-driven strategic document. It feels like a modern business report come to life.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: The entire site is built on a visible or implied modular grid.
  - **Typographic Hierarchy**: Massive headings contrast with small, precise body text.
  - **Horizontal Scroll**: The SWOT section might utilize a horizontal scroll to treat each quadrant with equal importance.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Bold Lines**: Thick black dividers between sections.
  - **Oversized Numbers**: Using large numerals for data points (e.g., "79%" of consumers).
  - **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles and squares to frame images or data.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Micro-Interactions**: Buttons and links have sharp, immediate feedback (color inversion).
  - **Cursor Effects**: A custom cursor that changes state over interactive elements.

  **Animation**:
  - **Kinetic Typography**: Headings that slide in or assemble themselves.
  - **Sharp Transitions**: No soft fades; cuts and slides are precise.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Primary**: *Helvetica Now* or *Inter* (Bold/Black weights for headers).
  - **Secondary**: *Roboto Mono* (Monospace) - For data points and captions, adding a technical feel.

  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Paper Craft
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Rawness**: Exposed structures, borders, and "unfinished" looks.
  2. **Tactility**: Elements look like they are made of paper, card, or physical materials.
  3. **Boldness**: High contrast, heavy strokes, and assertive layout.
  4. **Playfulness**: A serious topic presented with engaging, almost gamified visuals.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Off-white / Paper texture (#F0F0F0).
  - **Borders**: Stark Black (#000000).
  - **Highlights**: Muted Pastels (Sage Green, Dusty Pink, Slate Blue) to differentiate SWOT quadrants.
  - **Intent**: To make the analysis feel tangible and "work-in-progress," inviting the user to engage with the content as a workshop tool.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Masonry Layout**: Content blocks fit together like a puzzle.
  - **Overlapping Elements**: Cards might slightly overlap to create depth without shadows (using borders instead).
  - **Container Queries**: Highly responsive components that rearrange internally.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Hard Shadows**: Solid black drop shadows (no blur) to create a "sticker" effect.
  - **Visible Grids**: Dotted backgrounds or graph paper textures.
  - **Brutalist Buttons**: Rectangular, sharp-edged buttons with hover lift effects.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Draggable Elements**: Users might be able to rearrange SWOT cards (or just feel like they can).
  - **Click-to-Expand**: Cards flip or expand to reveal details.

  **Animation**:
  - **Spring Physics**: Bouncy animations for entrance and interaction.
  - **Paper Fold**: Elements unfolding to reveal content.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Space Grotesk* - Quirky, modern sans-serif with character.
  - **Body**: *DM Sans* - Geometric but readable.
